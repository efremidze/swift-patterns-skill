## Integration Check

### Missing Connections

- `swift-agent-skill/SKILL.md` Quick Decision Guide links to `swift-agent-skill/references/code-review-refactoring.md`, but that reference does not enforce Constraints and includes disallowed content (tool-specific steps, formatting rules, UIKit examples). This breaks the constraints guarantee for that flow.

### Broken Flows

- Quick Decision Guide → references → code-review-refactoring.md (fails constraints compliance)

## Tech Debt

None recorded.

## Recommendation

Plan a gap-closure update to align `swift-agent-skill/references/code-review-refactoring.md` with Constraints and add a Constraints link to that reference.
